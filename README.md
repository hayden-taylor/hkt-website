# Design for Emerging and Nanoscale Manufacturing: Jekyll site

This folder is a Jekyll version of the PHP site in the parent `online` folder, ready for GitHub Pages. The PHP site is untouched and can stay live on OCF until you switch over.

## What changed from the PHP site

- Every page is plain HTML with a short YAML "front matter" header (title, description, panel title, banner images). The shared header, menu and footer are in `_layouts/default.html` and `_includes/nav.html`, so the menu is edited in one place.
- The research tiles and the Previous/Next project links are generated from `_data/projects.csv` (same columns as `research/projects.csv`; set `Include?` to 1 to show a project). The order of rows sets the order of tiles.
- The OCF logo has been removed from the homepage.
- Accessibility (WCAG 2.1 AA): page language set; skip-to-content link; one `h1` per page with `h2` section headings; alt text on every image (figure images take the first sentence of their caption; decorative banners have empty alt); visible gold focus ring; body text and link colors at 4.5:1 contrast or better (the old grey menu links and 11–13 px text were below that); underlined links; `aria-current` on the active menu item; videos have controls and pause automatically if the visitor has "reduce motion" set; Previous/Next links are no longer fixed over the text; layout reflows to a single column on phones with no sideways scrolling at 320 px.

## One-time setup

1. **Copy the media files.** Double-click `copy-assets.bat`. It copies `images`, `pdf`, `ppt` and `videos` from the parent folder into this one. (They are online-only in OneDrive at the moment, so they couldn't be copied automatically.)
2. **Create a GitHub repository** (e.g. `hkt-website`), and push the contents of this folder to it (GitHub Desktop is the easiest way: File > Add local repository > this folder > Publish).
3. **Turn on Pages:** repository Settings > Pages > Source: "Deploy from a branch", branch `main`, folder `/ (root)`. The site appears at `https://<username>.github.io/<repo>/` within a minute or two.
   - If you view it at that address *before* adding a custom domain, set `baseurl: "/<repo>"` in `_config.yml`; set it back to `""` once the custom domain is live.
4. **Custom domain:** register the domain (a `.com` or `.org` is safer than `.io`). In Settings > Pages > Custom domain, enter e.g. `www.haydentaylor.org`; GitHub will add a `CNAME` file. At your registrar add:
   - `CNAME` record: `www` → `<username>.github.io`
   - `A` records for the bare domain: `185.199.108.153`, `185.199.109.153`, `185.199.110.153`, `185.199.111.153`
   Then tick "Enforce HTTPS". Optionally, put a redirect from the old OCF address to the new one in the PHP `index.php`.

## Editing

- **Text on a page:** edit the corresponding `.html` file below the front matter.
- **Add a research project:** copy an existing project page (e.g. `OTEC.html`), change its front matter and text, add a 240 × 240 px thumbnail to `images/`, and add a row to `_data/projects.csv`.
- **Menu:** `_includes/nav.html`. **Styles:** `assets/css/site.css`.

## Previewing locally (optional)

Install Ruby (rubyinstaller.org, with DevKit), then in this folder run `bundle install` once and `bundle exec jekyll serve`, and open http://localhost:4000.
